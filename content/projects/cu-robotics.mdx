## Problem

Student robotics teams ship ambitious hardware, but documentation rarely keeps pace. On CU Robotics I focused on changing that so every subsystem—vision, controls, firmware—had a clear entry point.

## Contributions

- **Docs overhaul.** Wrote contributor guides for `hive-rs`, `swarm`, `waggle`, and `firmware` that explain architecture, build steps, and debugging tips.
- **Process automation.** Introduced issue templates, PR checklists, and linters to keep contributions consistent.
- **Mentorship.** Ran onboarding sessions that paired new members with maintainers and codified tribal knowledge into READMEs.

## Outcome

The org now has a single source of truth that keeps projects moving even as student rosters change. Documentation isn’t an afterthought—it’s how we ship faster robots.
