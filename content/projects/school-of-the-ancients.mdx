> “Understanding people. Building things they want. Getting those things in front of them.”

A mixed-reality learning environment for the NASA SUITS 2026 challenge. The project explores how agents can teach problem solving in the field, blending embodied interaction with voice-driven Socratic guidance.

## Highlights

- Unity application that runs on Quest headsets with hand tracking and spatialized voice prompts.
- GPT-4o orchestrates lesson plans, evaluates astronaut intent, and generates adaptive hints in real time.
- Built an internal scripting DSL to choreograph mentor timelines, safety checks, and holographic overlays.
- Designed telemetry hooks so researchers can replay student sessions and iterate on pedagogy.

## Why it matters

Astronaut crews need fast, intuitive training refreshers in the field. School of the Ancients shows how AI mentors can augment critical missions without overwhelming operators.
