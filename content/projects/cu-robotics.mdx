I help lead build nights and research sprints for CU Robotics — a student lab focused on autonomous systems and
manipulation. The work ranges from PCB bring-up and firmware debugging to perception pipelines and robot operations.

- Coordinated cross-team experiments spanning embedded firmware, ROS nodes, and simulation tooling.
- Documented wiring diagrams and debug playbooks so new members can ship hardware safely and repeatably.
- Built lightweight agentic helpers that watch telemetry and suggest next steps during long test sessions.

It's the place where we stress-test ideas from class, trade tricks, and turn napkin sketches into working robots.
