Algo tooling that keeps emotions out of the loop.

## Features

- Listens to TradingView webhooks, enriches the payload, and routes them into structured orders.
- Enforces risk parameters (max loss, stop placement, exposure) before any action is sent to the broker.
- Streams executions to a Supabase warehouse for journaling, tags, and performance dashboards.
- Ships alerts to Telegram and Discord so human teammates can monitor in real time.

## Tech stack

Python, FastAPI, Docker, Supabase, Redis, and a sprinkle of lightweight React for control panels.
