I lead software experiments for CU Robotics, a student-run lab exploring field robotics and autonomous systems.

- **Perception pipelines:** Prototyped stereo vision and AprilTag localization in ROS 2 for our ground robots.
- **Embedded control:** Designed Teensy-based motor controllers with CAN bus telemetry for arm and drive subsystems.
- **Team rituals:** Weekly build nights, sprint demos, and mentorship for new members who are touching hardware for the first time.

Working in the lab keeps my engineering practice grounded — soldering, debugging, and shipping features that physically move.
