AI Radar watches the firehose of technical news so humans can stay focused.

## Pipeline

1. **Ingestion.** Cron workers fan out across 200+ RSS feeds, normalize the payloads, and store embeddings in Supabase.
2. **Filtering.** A scoring agent ranks stories by novelty, domain relevance, and overlap with recent briefs.
3. **Summaries.** GPT-4o-mini drafts concise blurbs with citations and tags so readers can follow up quickly.
4. **Delivery.** A Next.js dashboard and email digest ship each morning with a “need-to-know” view.

## Notes

- Heavily typed TypeScript codebase with background jobs running on Vercel Cron + Supabase Edge Functions.
- Built custom evaluation harnesses to keep hallucinations low and highlight uncertain summaries.
- Adopted automated screenshot previews to make the reading experience visual and scannable.
