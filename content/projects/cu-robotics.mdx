As part of CU Robotics, I help architect the firmware, perception, and testing infrastructure that keeps our fleet moving.

- Led the bring-up of STM32-based motor controllers with field-oriented control for a modular drivetrain.
- Prototyped ROS 2 nodes that fuse depth cameras and wheel odometry for indoor navigation challenges.
- Built a hardware-in-the-loop rig so we can regression test locomotion code before competitions.
- Coordinated contributor onboarding and documentation to keep the student-led org shipping.

The club is a proving ground for systems thinking—balancing reliability with rapid iteration on real robots.
