My personal website, rebuilt with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Upstash, and Contentlayer, and deployed to Vercel.

### What’s new

- **Narrative-driven homepage.** Highlights current work across robotics, VR, and AI with quick access to portfolio and resume.
- **Contentlayer-powered projects.** MDX entries keep case studies versioned alongside code. Adding a project is a single commit.
- **Agentic AI focus.** Dedicated AI page summarises ongoing research, collaborations, and how I evaluate autonomous systems.

### Why it matters

thetopham.com is my canonical source of truth. This refresh aligns the site with my latest portfolio README, keeping hiring partners and collaborators on the same page.
