School of the Ancients is a mixed-reality learning experience that invites students to spar with AI mentors inside a custom Unity world. Whisper + GPT power natural speech, while spatialized prompts and adaptive lesson plans keep the conversation grounded in pedagogy. The project explores how embodied presence, voice, and agentic tooling can make complex ideas feel tactile again.

Key contributions:

- Designed the voice-first interaction loop that guides students through Socratic questioning.
- Implemented the Unity XR systems that synchronize AI responses with environmental cues and haptics.
- Built the evaluation pipeline that records transcripts, sentiment, and skill progression for instructors.
