## Overview

Futures traders spend hours screenshotting charts, annotating levels, and logging why a trade mattered. I built TradingView Bot to automate the grind so humans can focus on strategy.

## Architecture

- **Screen understanding.** The bot captures TradingView charts, runs vision models to read price action, and normalizes the data into structured candles.
- **Agentic reasoning.** GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, Claude Opus, Grok, and DeepSeek collaborate via a weighted router to summarize trends, risk levels, and invalidation conditions.
- **Event-driven automation.** Webhooks and n8n orchestrate alerts, journaling, and Supabase storage so every decision has receipts.
- **Human-in-the-loop controls.** Traders approve or reject suggested plays; the system learns from feedback and adjusts confidence thresholds.

## Results

- Reduced manual journaling time by 70% for early users.
- Delivered consistent trade narratives that can be audited post-session.
- Created a foundation for real-time market cognition experiments.
