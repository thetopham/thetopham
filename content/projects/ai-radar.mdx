## Goal

Stay current on the flood of AI research without living on Twitter. AI Radar ingests RSS feeds, clusters updates, and lets a language model draft a digest that I can review in minutes.

## Stack

- **Feed ingestion.** Feedparser pulls sources like arXiv, company blogs, and standards bodies.
- **Summarization.** GPT-based prompts condense each story, capture key numbers, and tag themes.
- **Publishing.** GitHub Actions schedules runs, writes to Markdown, and pushes an updated brief I can skim anywhere.

## Why I built it

The project keeps me sharp while I build larger agentic systems. It’s a lightweight lab for prompt design, evaluation, and automation—and a resource I share with friends who want signal without the noise.
