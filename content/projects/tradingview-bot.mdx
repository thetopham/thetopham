TradingView Bot acts as an always-on execution partner for my trading experiments. The system ingests webhook alerts from TradingView, normalizes the payloads, and triggers the right downstream automation — from updating spreadsheets to pinging brokers and Discord rooms. Secrets live in Vault, and every action is logged for post-trade review.

Highlights:

- Built a resilient webhook listener with retry logic and signature validation.
- Added pluggable strategy modules so I can test new ideas without rewriting the core service.
- Wired up notification bridges for SMS, email, and Discord to keep collaborators in the loop.
