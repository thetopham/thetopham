CU Robotics is where I prototype the hardware side of intelligent systems. I split time across the lab and field tests, wiring up embedded controllers, debugging ROS stacks, and helping classmates bring their mechanical concepts to life. We document everything in the open so future cohorts can iterate faster.

What I focus on:

- Rapid prototyping of drive systems, sensor arrays, and safety interlocks.
- Firmware bring-up for STM32- and RP2040-based control boards.
- Mentoring newer members on Git flows, simulation, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
