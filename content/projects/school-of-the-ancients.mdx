An immersive tutoring experience built in Unity for Quest that pairs hand-tracked rituals with an AI Socratic mentor.
Learners speak naturally to summon lessons, challenge assumptions, and receive contextual feedback that matches their
pace and curiosity. The interaction loop is powered by GPT, with carefully designed prompts that keep the mentor grounded
and focused on real study goals.

- Designed ambient voice UX so learners can stay heads-up in VR while conversing with the mentor.
- Built a ritual system that anchors core ideas to spatial memory palaces and gesture-driven actions.
- Integrated OpenAI APIs with Unity to stream responses and surface citations for every answer.

The result is a mentorship environment that feels alive—part study buddy, part coach, and part philosopher—helping
students explore complex concepts without feeling alone inside the headset.
