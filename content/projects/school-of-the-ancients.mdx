The School of the Ancients is an immersive mentor experience designed for the Meta Quest platform. Learners step into a virtual study hall and call upon historical mentors through voice. The mentor agents reason over curated knowledge graphs, leverage OpenAI tools for Socratic questioning, and react to the learner’s intent using spatialized audio cues.

### Why build this?

Mixed reality promises deeper focus, but only if the experience feels alive. I wanted to move beyond static lesson plans and give learners a dynamic companion that adapts in real time. The project explores **agentic AI** inside VR — blending language models, procedural storytelling, and embodied interaction.

### Key capabilities

- **Voice-first dialogue** with Whisper transcription and custom prompt pipelines.
- **Spatial UX** with hand-tracked gestures, 3D UI anchoring, and adaptive lighting to match mentor energy.
- **Knowledge routing** that chooses between curated lecture notes, semantic search, or free-form synthesis.
- **Session journaling** that syncs reflections to Supabase for follow-up micro-lessons.

### What I’m iterating on now

- Building a multiplayer classroom mode for collaborative prompts.
- Extending the mentor roster with experts in robotics, finance, and creative practice.
- Experimenting with lightweight on-device inference for the most common question paths.

This work feeds directly into my research on agentic AI and mixed-reality interfaces at CU Boulder. It’s a playground for testing how thoughtful storytelling and reliable tooling can make learning in VR genuinely delightful.
