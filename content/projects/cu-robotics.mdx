My work with CU Robotics spans hardware, firmware, and operator tooling for campus competition teams. We iterate quickly on prototypes, validate control loops, and make sure the software stack is debuggable even when hardware is finicky.

### Areas of focus

- **Motor control experiments.** Designing brushless driver boards, tuning PID loops, and benchmarking torque profiles.
- **Embedded telemetry.** Building Rust and C++ firmware that streams sensor data into ROS2 pipelines for later analysis.
- **Operator dashboards.** Lightweight web tooling that lets teams replay runs, annotate failures, and spin up new experiments faster.

### Impact

These efforts helped the team increase iteration speed between lab tests and field trials, and gave underclassmen clearer entry points into the robotics stack. It’s also a proving ground for my interest in blending hardware intuition with software reliability.
