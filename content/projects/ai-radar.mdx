AI Radar watches dozens of RSS feeds, newsletters, and arXiv alerts so builders get a concise morning download of what matters.

- Designed a modular ingestion pipeline that normalizes sources, deduplicates stories, and tags them by theme.
- Built a summarization agent that blends GPT-4 turbo with custom prompts to capture why a story matters in three sentences.
- Published the brief to a responsive microsite and email digest with zero manual editing.
- Logged interaction metrics to tune which stories surface to the top.

It’s my personal early-warning system for breakthroughs in models, robotics, and human-computer interaction.
