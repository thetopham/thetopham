TradingView Bot connects TradingView alerts, Alpaca brokerage APIs, and a notification mesh so discretionary traders can safely test automated strategies.

- Created a rule engine that validates every signal against position sizing, risk, and cooldown constraints before execution.
- Streamed executions and errors into Supabase for dashboards that keep the human trader in control.
- Deployed the bot inside Docker with health checks, rotating secrets, and Slack/Pushover notifications.
- Added a paper-trading mode to compare automated performance against manual trades.

It’s a pragmatic take on algorithmic trading: automation that never forgets there is a person accountable for each order.
