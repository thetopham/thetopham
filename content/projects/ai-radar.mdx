AI Radar keeps a close eye on the AI ecosystem by watching custom RSS feeds, filtering the noise, and drafting
summaries you can actually skim. The pipeline fetches sources, deduplicates stories, and pushes them through GPT to
produce tight bulletins with links, context, and impact notes.

- Assembled a catalog of niche research feeds and vendor changelogs to surface signal before it trends.
- Tuned GPT prompts to retain citations, highlight red-team notes, and call out launch-readiness.
- Published the digest to a lightweight Supabase + Next.js frontend for fast browsing and search.

It’s my daily briefing for what’s shipping across AI — useful enough that friends asked to subscribe.
