## Mission summary

TUXEDO is our mixed-reality mission assistant for the NASA SUITS 2026 challenge. I am leading the proposal and technical design for an AI-first EVA copilot that keeps astronauts safe when they lose comms or visibility.

- **Offline cognition:** Chain-of-thought agents that plan on-device, monitor rover telemetry, and summarize mission-critical status without an internet connection.
- **Spatial overlays:** UE5-powered AR visuals to highlight terrain hazards, navigation cues, and rover intent inside the astronaut visor.
- **Rover autonomy:** Shared autonomy loops that let the rover scout ahead, stream vision context, and mark obstacles for the crew.

## My contributions

- Authored the winning concept package, technical architecture, and risk posture for our team submission.
- Prototyped the agent stack that binds perception, reasoning, and AR rendering through WebSockets and native plugins.
- Coordinated cross-disciplinary workstreams across AI, XR, and robotics to ensure an integrated field test.
