AI Radar keeps me — and a handful of collaborators — grounded in the pace of AI research. The system ingests dozens of RSS feeds, scores the stories, and routes the best ones through GPT for structured summaries that land in a searchable Supabase database.

### System overview

1. **Ingestion.** Cron jobs pull new articles from research labs, newsletters, and product teams, then de-duplicate via embeddings.
2. **Summarisation.** Articles are chunked and summarised through GPT with a style guide focused on clarity and actionable takeaways.
3. **Delivery.** Summaries surface in a Next.js dashboard with filters for topic, impact, and required reading time. A daily digest ships out via email.

### What I learned

- Prompt engineering alone isn’t enough — deterministic pipelines and evaluation harnesses keep summaries trustworthy.
- Lightweight visualisations (spark lines, release timelines) help translate dense papers into actionable insights for stakeholders.
- Supabase storage + edge functions make it painless to keep latency low while fan-out to multiple front-ends.

AI Radar is my sandbox for building AI-native news products that balance automation with editorial intent.
