School of the Ancients is an embodied learning environment that pairs Meta Quest hardware with an agentic GPT-4o mentor. Each lesson is a guided dialogue that reacts to the learner’s intent and gestures, while the space transforms to visualize abstract concepts.

- Built an intent router that balances scripted knowledge graphs with free-form reasoning from GPT-4o.
- Implemented Azure speech services for latency-sensitive transcription and expressive avatar speech.
- Authored a modular Unity interaction system so new lessons can be staged without rebuilding the world.
- Piloted with design students to validate comfort, pacing, and accessibility within VR.

The result is a repeatable recipe for turning dense topics into memorable, human conversations that play out in mixed reality.
