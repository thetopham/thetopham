A Python toolkit that watches TradingView webhooks and translates alerts into real trade actions. The bot pipes
signals through FastAPI, normalizes payloads, and fans them out to messaging, logging, and optional brokerage
integrations.

- Built a webhook ingestion service with FastAPI that handles authentication, replay protection, and structured logging.
- Added templated Discord and email updates so the trading team can see positions open, close, and trail in real time.
- Wrapped common brokerage actions (paper trading, risk checks, exit management) behind a clean strategy interface.

The result is a resilient automation layer that lets new strategies ship fast while staying observable and auditable.
