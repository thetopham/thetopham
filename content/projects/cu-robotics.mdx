Helping the CU Boulder robotics club prototype faster, teach better, and share discoveries in the open.

## Contributions

- Authored starter kits for ROS2 + microcontrollers so newcomers can flash firmware in minutes.
- Built calibration rigs and data loggers for vision experiments on low-cost hardware.
- Organized build nights, office hours, and documentation sprints to keep projects accessible.
- Partnered with faculty research labs to test autonomous navigation demos on campus.

## Impact

A tighter feedback loop between research and students — more hands on hardware, more demos at outreach events, and a growing code commons for future teams.
