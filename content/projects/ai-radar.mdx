AI Radar keeps my network current on the fast-moving AI ecosystem. A fleet of crawlers collects the latest research, funding news, and product drops, then streams summaries through GPT with custom system prompts. The result is a daily digest that cuts through the noise and highlights what matters for founders, engineers, and policy teams.

System features:

- A modular feed ingestion system that normalizes dozens of RSS sources.
- Summarization heuristics tuned to surface technical breakthroughs and strategic signals.
- Delivery channels for email, Telegram, and a searchable Supabase archive.
