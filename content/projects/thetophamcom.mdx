This site is my lab notebook on the web. It pairs a particle-infused hero, featured case studies, and Contentlayer-backed MDX entries so I can ship updates quickly. The design leans on Tailwind CSS, shadings inspired by the Matrix rain shader, and Upstash Redis to keep an eye on readership.

Key highlights:

- **Hero built for clarity.** A focused introduction, quick actions, and a “current focus” section distilled from my GitHub README.
- **Case-study library.** Projects live in MDX and surface on the homepage as featured builds with deep-dive pages.
- **Performance first.** Static generation via Next.js 13, image optimization, and analytics powered by Vercel.
