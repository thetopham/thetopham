The TradingView Bot is a modular Python service that connects TradingView alerts to real-world trading actions. Instead of brittle scripts, the bot orchestrates reusable “playbooks” that can log insights, notify teammates, and execute orders through exchange APIs.

### Highlights

- **Event-driven architecture.** Webhooks flow through FastAPI and land on a queue so multiple bots can collaborate without dropping signals.
- **Safety rails.** Every strategy can require human acknowledgement, throttle order size, or send dry-run messages before touching capital.
- **Transparent history.** Executions, alerts, and diagnostics pipe into Supabase/PostgreSQL so it’s easy to audit decisions or retrain models.
- **Messaging hooks.** Slack/Discord integrations broadcast context-rich updates so collaborators see what the agents are doing in real time.

### Why it matters

I wanted tooling that made automated trading understandable. The bot keeps traders in the loop, documents every move, and gives me a sandbox for experimenting with reinforcement learning policies without risking funds.
