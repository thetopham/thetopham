## Overview
CU Robotics is where I get my hands dirty with real robots. I collaborate across the student organization on embedded systems, control loops, and field tests. The goal: ship reliable hardware-software stacks that survive demos and competition days alike.

## Contributions
- Designed ROS nodes for sensor fusion and telemetry streaming on our autonomous rover.
- Helped bring up firmware pipelines for motor controllers and battery management.
- Built debug dashboards so new teammates can visualize states, issue commands, and replay logs.

## Impact
The tooling keeps multidisciplinary teammates aligned, letting the electrical, mechanical, and software crews iterate faster. It also informs my classroom work—bridging theory from robotics courses with the constraints of real-world deployments.
