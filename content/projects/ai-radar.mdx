## Problem

AI news is noisy. I wanted a lightweight way to track meaningful research without doomscrolling dozens of feeds each morning.

## Solution

- **Feed ingestion:** Feedparser collects updates from research blogs, arXiv categories, and product changelogs.
- **Summarization:** GPT agents evaluate relevance, extract key findings, and write scannable headlines.
- **Delivery:** GitHub Actions schedules the pipeline so a fresh brief lands in my inbox every day.

## Outcome

AI Radar keeps my attention on what matters — breakthroughs, not buzzwords — and gives collaborators a shared signal for what to explore next.
