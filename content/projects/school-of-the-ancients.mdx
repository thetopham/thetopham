School of the Ancients is a mixed-reality learning experiment where students are guided by a conversational mentor inside a fully spatial Quest experience. The system blends hand-tracked interactions, spatial audio, and GPT-4-powered dialogue to create Socratic tutoring sessions that adapt in real time.

- **Embodied instruction:** Students progress through narrative chapters that respond to their gaze, gestures, and voice input.
- **Agentic AI:** A chain-of-thought orchestration layer keeps the mentor on-rails academically while allowing space for exploratory coaching.
- **Built for Quest:** Authored in Unity with Meta's Interaction SDK, OpenXR, and a custom networking service for logging learning telemetry.

The project debuted as part of the CU Boulder Emerging Tech Studio, where we are researching how AI mentors can co-create with educators rather than replace them.
