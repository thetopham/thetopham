## Overview

Markets move fast, so I built a copilot that watches TradingView dashboards, interprets technical signals, and briefs traders before volatility hits.

- **Chart ingestion:** Automated screen parsing to capture OHLCV, indicators, and custom studies.
- **Reasoning loop:** Ensemble of GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, Claude Opus, Grok, and DeepSeek agents that debate risk and craft trade theses.
- **Alerting fabric:** Supabase and n8n workflows route decisions to Discord, SMS, or execution bots with full audit trails.

## Impact

The system surfaces higher-confidence entries, flags conflicting signals, and creates a searchable knowledge base of trades and lessons learned.
