## Why build it

Philosophy should feel alive, not like a textbook. School of the Ancients is my experiment in conversational learning — letting students step inside a mixed-reality academy and dialogue with mentors like Socrates or Galileo.

## What it does

- **Live mentorship:** Meta Horizon avatars powered by Gemini 2.5 audio models that deliver adaptive, voice-driven Socratic dialogue.
- **Spatial storytelling:** Scenes that react to the conversation, revealing artifacts, constellations, and interactive prompts as the discussion evolves.
- **Lesson architecture:** Modular TypeScript pipelines that script narratives, track curiosity metrics, and hand off to new mentors.

## My role

I designed and coded the XR interaction model, orchestrated the AI dialogue tooling, and built the orchestration layer that keeps the session coherent from greeting to reflective recap.
