AI Radar keeps a pulse on the rapid AI ecosystem by fetching curated RSS feeds, clustering related stories, and drafting concise daily briefings with GPT-4.

- **Signal over noise:** Deduplicates news items and promotes research, policy, and product updates that matter to builders.
- **Explainable summaries:** Generates 150-word briefs with linked sources, model version notes, and quick action items.
- **Delivery options:** Ships to email, Slack, or a JSON API so teams can embed the intel wherever they work.

It started as a personal dashboard for staying informed between classes and quickly became a tool my lab uses to align standups with the latest breakthroughs.
