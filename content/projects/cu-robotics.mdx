## Scaling the team

CU Robotics is a RoboMaster competition program with dozens of repos across firmware, controls, and simulation. New members struggled to ramp up, so I focused on knowledge infrastructure.

- **Playbooks:** Authored contributor guides for `hive-rs`, `swarm`, `waggle`, and `firmware` so teammates could understand architecture, build steps, and testing conventions.
- **Standards:** Established naming, branching, and PR templates that tightened feedback loops between mechanical and software pods.
- **Enablement:** Facilitated onboarding workshops and code walkthroughs to keep institutional memory inside the team.

The result: faster iteration cycles, fewer duplicated efforts, and a healthier robotics community.
