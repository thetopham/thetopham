## Overview

School of the Ancients is an immersive academy where students hold live conversations with historical mentors—Socrates, Galileo, Hypatia—inside a VR space. Each mentor runs on a Gemini-powered agent that listens, reasons, and responds with citations.

I designed the interaction model, built the Unity application, and wired the AI stack so each conversation feels like a guided seminar instead of a chatbot exchange.

## System highlights

- **Spatial dialogue system.** Students speak naturally; speech-to-text flows into Gemini 2.5, while gestures unlock contextual prompts and artifacts.
- **Dynamic lesson plans.** Mentors adapt conversations based on curiosity, scaffolding follow-up questions and surface references from curated knowledge graphs.
- **Multi-user ready.** Photon networking enables collaborative seminars, note-taking, and instructor overrides.
- **Education-first guardrails.** Moderation, memory trims, and transcript exports keep the experience safe and reviewable for classrooms.

## Impact

This project blends mixed reality, conversational AI, and pedagogy to make classical dialogue accessible. It’s part museum, part Socratic dojo, and a testing ground for how spatial interfaces can deepen learning.
