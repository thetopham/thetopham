TradingView Bot connects scripted strategies with live brokerage actions. It listens for webhook alerts, evaluates guardrails, and places orders through brokerage APIs so strategies can run unattended.

- **Safe automation:** Every alert is validated through a compliance checklist before hitting the brokerage, preventing accidental or duplicate orders.
- **Analytics-ready logs:** Trades, fills, and balance updates stream into Supabase for dashboards and backtesting reviews.
- **Stack built for iteration:** Python FastAPI backend, Redis task queue, and typed strategy configs to drop in new playbooks.

The bot started on campus as a tool for a quantitative finance study group and now powers my own experiments in systematic trading.
